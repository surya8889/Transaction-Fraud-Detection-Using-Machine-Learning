# Transaction-Fraud-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
Transaction fraud imposes serious threats on e-commerce shopping. As online transaction is becoming more popular types of online transaction frauds.
System has the capability to restrict and block the transaction performed by the attacker from genuine user's credit card details.
To overcome these problems, this system is developed for the transactions higher than the customer's current transaction limit. During registration we take required information which is efficient to detect fraudulent user actvity. The details of items purchased by any individual transaction are usually not known to any fraud detection system running at the bank that issues cards to the cardholders.
Today a financial transaction involves hundreds of parameters like transaction amount, past transaction trends, GPS location of the transaction, transaction time, merchant name, etc. We need to consider many parameters to detect an anomaly and fraud in realtime.
An FDS runs at a card issuing bank. Each incoming transaction is submitted to the FDS for verification. FDS receives the card details and transaction value to verify, whether the transaction is genuine or not.
The model successfully predicts whether the transaction is genuine or not, using machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes Algorithm. Which detect the hidden layer of the dataset where the behavior of dataset changed.
We can use this system in bank and insurance companies, for detecting fraud made in transactions.
